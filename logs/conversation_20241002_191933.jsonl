However, there's an interesting fact related to your question:\n\nThe phrase \"Capital of the Moon\" was once used as a temporary title for the city of Noordwijk in the Netherlands. This occurred from July 10 to 15 (the year isn't specified in the information provided, but it was likely in the early 2000s) when Noordwijk hosted the 4th International Conference on Exploration and Utilisation of the Moon (ICEUM4).\n\nNoordwijk was given this title because it's home to ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre), which is an establishment of the European Space Agency (ESA). The conference was organized by the International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG) and brought together various stakeholders to discuss lunar exploration and utilization.\n\nSo while the Moon itself doesn't have a capital, Noordwijk briefly held the honorary title of \"Capital of the Moon\" during this important space exploration conference."}}]}
